# Hello!

I'm a serverless architect and developer, using managed services first and FaaS when necessary to experiment and solve business problems as quickly and effectively as I can with the least amount of operational overhead possible.  I prefer TypeScript > JavaScript > Java.  IaC and automate all the things!

Some of my favorite tools include AWS (duh), CircleCI, and the Serverless Framework.  I'm always looking for better tools that let me solve more complex problems or the same problems more simply.

I'd love to connect and talk serverless shop!
